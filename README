The game 'Khet' made in python. 'Khet' is produced by Innovention Toys,
and can be found at http://www.khet.com. I own no rights or trademarks to
the game. This is just being used as a fun way for me to learn python.

Use arrow keys to move the cursor

Then press the arrow key of the direction you would lke the
